# Chris Dev React Native

This project can be used as a starting point to create your own React Native Application.
It contains all the necessary configuration and some placeholder files to get you started.

## Running the application
The project is a standard Expo project. To run it from the command line,
type `expo start` (Windows), or `expo start --android` (Android Emulator) or `expo start --ios` (iOS Simulator).
Then the app starts properly on your device.

You can also import the project to your IDE of choice as you would with any problems (in my case was VSCode)

## Project structure

- `src/view` contains all the view of the application.
- `src/components` contains all the .tsx files for create components
- `assets` folder in contains all the assets of the project
